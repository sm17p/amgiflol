## Target Audience

Any individual or web development teams including front-end developers, UI/UX designers, QA engineers, and product managers.

## Usage Note

Personally, I'm building this tool to act as an active visual debugger, since it is what I struggle with the most.

1. For others, it's intended to be used as an audit tool at the end or during development. Use it to reason about the layout like you would in a prototyping tool like Figma, or Adobe XD.
2. This tool won't automatically point out alignment or style mismatch with your designs.
3. You may find some shortcuts not implemented or upto the industry standard.
4. **This tool doesn't require you to login into any of your fav prototyping tool.**
