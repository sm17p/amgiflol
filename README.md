# Amgiflol - Figma-like Layout Inspector For Web

A browser extension that helps with design audit. Match web layouts with Figma designs through real-time element inspection, measurements, and visual overlays.

## Target Audience

Any individual or web development teams including front-end developers, UI/UX designers, QA engineers, and product managers.

## Usage Note

I'm building this tool to act as an active visual debugger, since it is what I struggle with the most. It's intended to be used at the end of a feature development or during the development cycle.

1. This tool won't automatically point out alignment or style mismatch with your designs.
2. Use during development or design audit cycle to get things right as early as possible.
3. You may find some shortcuts not implemented or upto the industry standard.
4. **This tool doesn't require you to login into any of your fav prototyping tool.**

## Current Features

- **Distance Measurements**: Meeasurements between element and it's parent
- **Dynamic Rulers**: Mouse-following coordinate system
- **Element Inspection**: Real-time hover detection with element information
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Quick access to all features
- **Lock/Unlock**: Persistent element tracking
- **Screenshots**: Capture current page state with overlays
- **Side Panel**: Detailed element properties, computed styles, attributes
- **Toolbar**: Floating interface with auto-positioning
